        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Before becoming interested in web devlopment, I went to West Virginia University and got a dual bachelor's degree in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. I am now pursuing a career in web development to add to my skillset and gain more flexibility in my career.</p>
        <p>One of my biggest passions in life is traveling and seeing new places.  I am hoping that a career in web development will allow me the flexibility to focus more on that.  My fiance and I are working on converting a van and hope to be able to live on the move for a few months at a time, traveling all over North America.  </p>
        <p>So far, I can provide services in basic front-end website design, including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.  Over the next few months, I will be learning more advanced skills in these areas as well as learning some back-end development to expand my skillset.  I am excited to continue to learn and develop these skills to become a great developer who can offer professional services across a full-stack project.</p>
