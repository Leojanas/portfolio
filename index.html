        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Before becoming interested in web development, I went to West Virginia University and got a 
          dual B.S. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. I am now pursuing a career in web development 
          to expand my knowledge base and gain more flexibility in my career.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am now almost finished with Bloc's Web Developer Track.  I have learned full stack development using
          React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. The course has also taught me about RESTful APIs, the basics of 
          data structures and algorithms, styling with Vanilla CSS, and version control with Git. I also have had
          some exposure to many other tools and libraries, including testing with Mocha and Chai. 
          I am excited to continue to learn and develop these skills and work with a team of other great programmers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time I love hiking, camping, and playing sports.  I moved to Utah a few years ago to be closer to
          great mountains and outdoor recreation.  My wife and I play in a beach volleyball league, and also love 
          to meet up with friends to play spikeball, frisbee, kickball, softball, etc.  I

              Kitchen Counter is a full stack web application that maintains a grocery inventory.  
              It allows the user to save and use recipes, build a mealplan, and generate a shopping list.
            </p>
            <p>
              I built this app because I often have trouble keeping track of what groceries I have at Home
              and what I need to buy.  I see Kitchen Counter as a way to make shopping easier and avoid checking 
              the cupboards and fridge every time you need to shop.

              Veggie Time is an app that helps track and schedule your vegetable garden.  Create an account, add vegetables, 
              record and schedule tasks, and see expected sprouting and harvest dates.

            <p>I built this app to have a single place to plan and track a vegetable garden. </p>

            <p>Find Trails is a front end client that uses data from The Hiking Project as well as Google Maps to allow the user to search and filter nearby trails.</p>
            <p>
              I built this app because I love hiking, and found that it would be helpful to be able to filter trails 
              based on length and elevation gain to find exactly the type of hike you want on any given day.
